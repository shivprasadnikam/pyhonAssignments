## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
Ans: Cause Python is easy is to understand to humans  and writing code in python  feels like writing English 

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
Ans: In python we don’t have to declare variables and assign memory 

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
Ans: Pros
Easy to understand as well for beginner it can be his/her first programming lang
Can be use for various purpose like web dev,ML,DS,AI etc 

Cons:
As python Is interpreted lang it took a lot of time for execution
As python Is learn for everyone but at same time for python programmer to shift from to any other lang is hard like python to C++ , py to Java etc and they require a proper syntax

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
Ans: Python can be used in Web Dev , AI , ML , DS, Data analytics , Data engineering etc

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
Ans: Variables are things we require to store any value can have any type of data 
In Python its not a compulsory to declare variable before
Example num =5
In these way we can declare different type of variables

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
Ans:  num =input() for taking input for user we have to use input() function

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
Ans:String

Q8. What is type casting?
Ans: Converting one day to another data type
There are two types of type casting
Implicit  Typecasting:Python converts datatype automatically
Explicit Typecasting: Python need user involvement to convert the variable data type into certain data type in order to the operation required



Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
Ans: Yes , using split()
Ex: a,b,c=input(“Enter the values:”).split()




Q10. What are keywords?
Ans: Special reserverd words that have special meaning and we cannot use them as variable name

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
Ans:No , Keywords are reserved words with special purpose

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
Ans: Indentation means
If conditions:
	print(“condition fullfil”)
that spacing between print and if is known as indentation

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
Ans: By using print()

Q14. What are operators in Python?
Ans: Operators are use to perform certain operations on operants there are some operators such as arthimatic operators, bitwise,conditional etc

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
Ans: “/” means division operator 
	“//” floor division operator


Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```
Ans:print(“iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron”)

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.
Ans:
num=int(input())
if num%2==0:
    print("num is even")
else:
    print("num is odd")

Q18. What are boolean operator?
Ans: Boolean operators are those that take Boolean inputs and return Boolean results. True,false,AND,NOT

Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0
Output: 1

0 and 0
Output: 0

True and False and True
Output:false

1 or 0 or 0
Output:1
```

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
Ans; if else in python known as conditional statments

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
Ans: to solve problem where we have to deal with certain condition

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
Ans: 
age=int(input())
if age>=18:
    print("I can vote")
else:
    print("I can't vote")


Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
Ans:
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
sum=0
for num in numbers:
    if num%2==0:
        sum=num+sum
print(sum)


Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.
Ans;
a,b,c=input("Enter values:").split()
if a>b and b>c:
    print(a)
elif b>a and a>c:
    print(b)
else:
    print(c)

Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
Ans:
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
for num in numbers:
    if num>500:
        break
    elif num%5==0 and num<150:
        print(num)
